        <a href="#">The Coconut tree, scientifically known as <i>Cocos nucifera</i>, is a versatile palm species native to the tropical coasts of the Indo-Pacific. It is often referred to as the “Tree of Life” due to its wide range of uses — from food and drink to materials for shelter, tools, and crafts.</a>
        <a href="#">In traditional medicine and cultural practices, coconut is highly valued. Coconut oil is used for skin and hair health, coconut water is consumed for hydration, and the dried kernel (copra) has applications in cooking and natural remedies.</a>
        <a href="#">Ecologically, coconut trees are crucial in coastal ecosystems. They prevent soil erosion, stabilize shorelines, and support biodiversity by offering shade and habitat. Their ability to thrive in sandy, saline soils makes them ideal for areas vulnerable to sea-level rise.</a>
